To do:
- Make constants at the top so you can easily change how many horses are in race and size of your screen. Just make it all work.

Done: 
- Race again button
- Race Sim (Blessing)
- Betting screen
- Horse Images
- Horse Names 
- Results
- Add a bar at the top of the screen with all horses to show which horse is in the lead and how much of the race they have left

Future Plans:

- Improve betting with actual amounts
- Custom Horse (Huge Task)

- Save Game
